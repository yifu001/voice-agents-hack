## Prerequisites

### Devices Required

| Label | Phone | Role | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| **Phone 0** | iPhone (iOS 16+) | Commander (Root) | Organiser device — creates the network |
| **Phone 1** | iPhone (iOS 16+) | Alpha Lead (L1) | Intermediate node — compacts child messages |
| **Phone 2** | iPhone (iOS 16+) | Bravo Lead (L1) | Leaf node under root |
| **Phone 3** | iPhone (iOS 16+) | Alpha-1 (L2) | Leaf node under Alpha Lead |

All 4 phones must be iPhone 15 or 16 series (8 GB RAM minimum for Gemma 4 E4B inference at INT4).

**Physically label each phone** with tape or a sticky note: `Phone 0`, `Phone 1`, `Phone 2`, `Phone 3`.

### Build & Install

1. Open `/Users/yifuzuo/Desktop/yifu/startup/projects/hackathon/YC-hack/TacNet.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select your Apple Developer team under **Signing & Capabilities** for the `TacNet` target.
3. For each phone:
   - Connect via USB.
   - Select the device in Xcode's destination picker.
   - `Cmd+R` to build and run.
   - Trust the developer certificate on the phone: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**.
4. Repeat for all 4 phones. Keep Xcode console open on a Mac to view logs (connect via USB or wireless debugging).

### Model Weights (First Launch)

- The app downloads **6.7 GB** of Gemma 4 E4B INT4 weights on first launch.
- **Ensure all phones are on WiFi** before first launch.
- Download takes 5–15 minutes depending on connection speed.
- You can install and launch on all 4 phones simultaneously to download in parallel.
- After download completes once, the weights persist across app relaunches.

### Console Log Access

- Connect each phone to a Mac via USB.
- Open **Console.app** (macOS) or Xcode's debug console.
- Filter by process name `TacNet` to see relevant logs.
- Alternatively, use `Xcode → Debug → Attach to Process` for phones not actively running from Xcode.

### Tree Topology for Testing

All tests use this hierarchy (created in Phase 3):

```
Phone 0: Commander (Root)
├── Phone 1: Alpha Lead (L1)
│   └── Phone 3: Alpha-1 (L2)
└── Phone 2: Bravo Lead (L1)
```

---

## Phase 1: First Launch & Model Download

**Phones used:** Phone 0 only (fresh install)
**Goal:** Verify model download progress UI, feature gating, and Cactus SDK initialization.

> If you already downloaded the model during setup, delete and reinstall the app on Phone 0 to test fresh.

### Step 1.1: Fresh Install — Download Progress UI

1. **Action (Phone 0):** Launch the app for the first time on WiFi.
2. **Observe (Phone 0):** A download progress screen appears showing:
   - A percentage indicator (0% → 100%)
   - Progress updates monotonically (never jumps backward)
3. **Observe (Phone 0):** At least 5 intermediate progress updates appear between 0% and 100%.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-RES-005**

### Step 1.2: Feature Gate During Download

2. **Observe (Console log, Phone 0):** Look for log messages indicating:
   - `cactusInit` succeeded (non-nil handle returned)
   - A trivial `cactusComplete` call returned a non-empty string
   - `cactusDestroy` completed without crash (or the context is held for reuse)
3. **Observe (Phone 0):** The app transitions to the main screen (Create/Join Network) without errors.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-FOUND-008**, **VAL-CROSS-001** (first part: model download → cactusInit)

1. **Observe (All 4 phones):** Within 5 seconds of each claim:
   - **Phone 0:** Shows Commander (self), Alpha Lead (Phone 1), Bravo Lead (Phone 2), Alpha-1 (Phone 3) — all claimed.
   - **Phone 1, 2, 3:** Each shows the same claim status on all nodes.
2. **Verify:** The CLAIM message propagated to every peer and all tree views are consistent.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-TREE-010**

### Step 3.9: Claim Conflict — Simultaneous Claim

1. **Action (Phone 0):** Unpublish and recreate the network. Add a new open node **"Scout"** under Commander. Publish.
2. **Action:** Have Phone 1 and Phone 2 rejoin the network.
3. **Action (Phone 1 and Phone 2 simultaneously):** Both tap **"Scout"** → **Claim this role** at the exact same moment.
4. **Observe:** The organiser (Phone 0) wins the conflict. The loser receives a `CLAIM_REJECTED` message and returns to role selection. All peers show a consistent state.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-TREE-011**, **VAL-CROSS-011**

> **After this step:** Restore the standard 4-node topology. Make sure all phones are joined and roles claimed as:
> Phone 0 = Commander, Phone 1 = Alpha Lead, Phone 2 = Bravo Lead, Phone 3 = Alpha-1.

### Step 3.10: TREE_UPDATE Does Not Reset Existing Claims

1. **Action (Phone 0):** In the tree editor, add a new node **"Alpha-2"** under Alpha Lead.
2. **Observe (All 4 phones):** The new node appears on all devices within 5 seconds.

### Step 4.5: Bravo Lead Contribution (Phone 2)

1. **Action (Phone 2):** PTT: **"Bravo in position east side, all clear"**.
2. **Observe (Phone 0):** Bravo Lead's transcript or compaction appears in the live feed (Bravo Lead is a direct child of Commander, so the broadcast is visible to Phone 0).

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-COMM-015**

### Step 4.6: Root SITREP (Phone 0)

1. **Observe (Phone 0):** After receiving compactions from both Alpha Lead and Bravo Lead, Phone 0's compaction engine runs and produces a top-level **SITREP**.
2. **Observe (Phone 0):** The SITREP appears on screen summarizing both squads (e.g., "Alpha reports contact building 4. Bravo in position, clear.").

> This test requires a deeper tree. Temporarily modify the topology.

1. **Action (Phone 0):** Add a new node **"Alpha-1-Sub"** under Alpha-1. Have no phone claim it (or use a 5th phone if available). The point is to verify cascading logic.
2. **Actual test with 4 phones (simplified):** With the standard topology, first disconnect Phone 1 (Alpha Lead). Phone 3 (Alpha-1) reparents to Commander (tested in 7.1). Now also observe that if Phone 3 were disconnected too, its hypothetical children would reparent further up.
3. **Alternative verification (Console log, Phone 0):** Check that the auto-reparent logic traverses upward through the tree correctly. Log output should show the algorithm finding the nearest connected ancestor.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-RES-010**

### Step 7.5: Priority Escalation — "Casualty" Keyword

2. **Observe (Phone 0):** Phone 0 loses organiser controls (Edit Tree button disappears or becomes disabled).
3. **Observe (Phone 1):** Phone 1 gains organiser controls (Edit Tree button appears and is enabled).
4. **Observe (All phones):** No dual-organiser state. The transition is atomic.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-CROSS-005** (partial: promote)

### Step 7.7: New Organiser Edits Tree

1. **Action (Phone 1 — new organiser):** Add a node **"Alpha-2"** under Alpha Lead.
2. **Observe (All 4 phones):** The new node appears within 3 seconds on all devices.
3. **Action (Phone 1):** Remove the **"Alpha-2"** node.
4. **Observe:** Communication continues uninterrupted throughout organiser handover and edits.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-CROSS-005** (full: promote → edit → propagate → comms uninterrupted)

> **Cleanup:** Promote Phone 0 back to organiser (Phone 1 promotes Phone 0), or recreate the network from Phone 0.

3. **Observe (Phone 3):** Phone 3 can read the new message (received key on join).

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-CROSS-008** (full: PIN join → key exchange → late joiner)

### Step 8.7: Encryption Key Not Leaked in Logs

1. **Action:** On the Mac, grep the Xcode console output for all 4 phones.
2. **Search for:** PIN digits ("5678"), base64 strings of key length (32+ chars), or any key material.
3. **Observe:** No key material, PIN plaintext, or key-length base64 strings in console logs.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-RES-011**

> - Phone 0 and Phone 3 should be far apart (different rooms if possible)
> - Phone 1 between Phone 0 and Phone 3
> - Phone 2 near Phone 0
>
> This ensures messages from Phone 3 may need to hop through Phone 1 to reach Phone 0.

### Step 9.1: Message Flooding Across 3 Phones

1. **Action (Phone 3 — Alpha-1):** Send a PTT message: **"Flood test from Alpha-1"**.
2. **Observe (Console log, Phone 1):** Message received from Phone 3 with original `sender_id` (Alpha-1) and TTL decremented by 1 from original.
3. **Observe (Console log, Phone 1):** Phone 1 re-broadcasts the message.
4. **Observe (Console log, Phone 0):** Message received (either directly from Phone 3 or relayed via Phone 1) with `sender_id` still showing Alpha-1 and TTL further decremented.
5. **Verify:** `sender_id` is preserved through hops. TTL is decremented at each hop.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-BLE-003**

### Step 9.2: TTL Decrement and Drop at Zero

1. **Action:** If possible via debug settings or code, send a message with `TTL=2` from Phone 3.
2. **Observe (Console log, Phone 1):** Receives with TTL=1, re-broadcasts.
3. **Observe (Console log, Phone 0):** Receives with TTL=0, does **NOT** re-broadcast.
4. **Observe (Console log, Phone 2):** If Phone 2 is out of direct range of Phone 3 and Phone 1, it should **NOT** receive the message (TTL exhausted before reaching it).

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-BLE-005**

### Step 9.4: UUID Dedup Prevents Infinite Loops

1. **Action (Phone 3):** Send a message. Due to mesh topology, the message may reach some phones via multiple paths.
2. **Observe (Console log, all phones):** Each phone logs exactly **one** `processMessage` event for this message UUID. No phone processes the same UUID twice.
3. **Verify:** No infinite relay loops. Message is seen once per device.

- [ ] **Pass / Fail** — Verifies: **VAL-BLE-006**

### Step 9.5: Store-and-Forward Across 4 Phones

1. **Physical setup:** Arrange phones in a chain: Phone 0 ↔ Phone 1 ↔ Phone 2 ↔ Phone 3 (each only in BLE range of its neighbors).
2. **Action (Phone 3):** Send a PTT message: **"Chain relay test"**.
3. **Observe (Console log, Phone 2):** Receives from Phone 3, relays.
4. **Observe (Console log, Phone 1):** Receives from Phone 2, relays.
5. **Observe (Console log, Phone 0):** Receives from Phone 1. `sender_id` is still Alpha-1 (Phone 3). TTL decremented 3 times from original.
